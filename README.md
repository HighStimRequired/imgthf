The setup.bat script will install all the needed dependencies (including Python itself, if absent) but the required ones are:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `tkinter`

## Notes
A couple of things to keep in mind:
- After running setup.bat once you can just use the run.bat script to run it
- Some websites might block automated requests, so imgthf might not work everywhere.
- If a site uses JavaScript to load images, you may need a more advanced tool.
